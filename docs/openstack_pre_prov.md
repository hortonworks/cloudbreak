#Provisioning Prerequisites

## Generate a new SSH key

All the instances created by Cloudbreak are configured to allow key-based SSH,
so you'll need to provide an SSH public key that can be used later to SSH onto the instances in the clusters you'll create with Cloudbreak.
You can use one of your existing keys or you can generate a new one.

To generate a new SSH keypair:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
```

```
# Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
You'll be asked to enter a passphrase, but you can leave it empty.

# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

After you enter a passphrase the keypair is generated. The output should look something like below.
```
# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:sd:17:sd:7d:sd:68:9d:sd:a2:sd your_email@example.com
```

Later you'll need to pass the `.pub` file's contents to Cloudbreak and use the private part to SSH to the instances.

## Next steps

After these prerequisites are done you can move on to create clusters on the [UI](openstack_cb_ui.md) or with the [Shell](openstack_cb_shell.md).
