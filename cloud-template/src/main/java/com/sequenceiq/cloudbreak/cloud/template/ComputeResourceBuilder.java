/**
 * Cloud providers which do not support template based deployments (like AWS Cloudformation, Azure ARM or OpenStack Heat) this interface is used to create the
 * compute
 * resources <b>individually</b>. Compute resources are grouped by the {@link ResourceType}. These types of builders will be called after all the
 * {@link GroupResourceBuilder} are finished.
 * For example to create an instance on the Google Cloud Platform it is required to create
 * - GCP_F
 * - GCP_ATTACHED_DISK
 * - GCP_INSTANCE
 * which means 3 different compute resource builders. These resource builders are ordered {@link OrderedBuilder#order()} which means you have to provide the
 * order of the resource creation. In the example above on GCP first the root disk will be created after that the attached disks and then at the end the
 * actual instance will be created. For instance creation it is most likely to need the resources created by an early builder so these resources should
 * be provided by the generic {@link ResourceBuilderContext} objects which will be passed along with the creation process.
 * <p/>
 * To remove the corresponding compute resources the builders will be called in <b>reverse</b> order. It the example above it will be called as:
 * - GCP_INSTANCE
 * - GCP_ATTACHED_DISK
 * - GCP_DISK
 * It is possible that the instance deletion will delete all the resources as well which is a normal scenario, see the documentation on the delete method.
 * <p/>
 * These type of resources <b>can be rolled back</b>. It means if the creation of an instance fails does not automatically mean that the whole deployment
 * fails. The failure policy can determine when to rollback the whole deployment {@link com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.cloud.template.compute.CloudFailureHandler}.
 * The rollback is handled automatically by Cloudbreak by calling the appropriate delete methods of the different resource builders.
 * <p/>
 * In order to make use of this interface and call the resource builders in ordered fashion the cloud provider implementation should extend
 * {@link AbstractResourceConnector} which is a base implementation of {@link com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.cloud.ResourceConnector}.
 * Eventually all the cloud provider implementations use {@link com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.cloud.ResourceConnector}. Providers which support some form of
 * template deployments should use that interface directly.
