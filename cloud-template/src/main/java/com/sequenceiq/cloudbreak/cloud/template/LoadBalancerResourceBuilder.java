/**
 * Cloud providers which do not support template based deployments (like AWS Cloudformation, Azure ARM)
 * this interface is used to create the load balancer resources <b>individually</b>. loadbalancer resources are grouped by the {@link ResourceType}.
 * For example to create the necessary network infrastructure for GCP, it is required to have the following network builders:
 * GCP_HEALTHCHECK
 * GCP_BACKEND_SERVICE
 * GCP_FORWARDING_RULE
 * These resource builders are ordered {@link OrderedBuilder#order()} which means you can provide the
 * order of the resource creation. For instance creation it is most likely to need the resources created by an early builder so these resources should
 * be provided by the generic {@link ResourceBuilderContext} objects which will be passed along with the creation process.
 * <br>
 * To remove the corresponding network resources the builders will be called in <b>reverse</b> order. It the example above it will be called as:
 * GCP_FORWARDING_RULE
 * GCP_BACKEND_SERVICE
 * GCP_HEALTHCHECK
 * <br>
 * In order to make use of this interface and call the resource builders in ordered fashion the Cloud provider implementation should extend
 * {@link AbstractResourceConnector} which is a base implementation of {@link com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.cloud.ResourceConnector}. Eventually all the
 * Cloud provider implementations use {@link com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.cloud.ResourceConnector}. Providers which support some form of template deployments
 * should use that interface directly.
